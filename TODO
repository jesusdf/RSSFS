- It doesnt download the torrents right (binary file). WGET does it right.
- At the initial fetching, the data should be stored somewhere, so we dont have to call fetch_url again in read()
- Implement arguments, so we can pass the URL by argument.
- There should be a flag to enable debug messages through syslog.
- There should be error handling (i.e, wrong url, cant access)
- The rss parser should implement support for pubDate, so we can set the date for the files
