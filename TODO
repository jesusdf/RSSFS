By priority:

- A minor corruption occurs when downloading torrents, see if we can better understand the code
- See if we can get the file sizes through the Content-Lenght header
- Store the <lastBuildDate>, <pubDate> of an <item>, and <itemSize> if present
- Implement multi threaded loop to fetch the feed considering <lastBuildDate>
- Better syslog logging messages
