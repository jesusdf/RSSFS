- At the initial fetching, the data should be stored somewhere, so we dont have to call fetch_url again in read(). Or in the initial fetch, just get the file sizes.

- File name should be striped of invalid characters with str_replace() (Implemented, but we need to find out which characters are valid)
- Better syslog messages.
